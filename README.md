# Looking to add some code for processing Comma-Separated Value (CSV) files to your ADACS templated Python project?
This template takes the effort out of starting from a good place.

## Getting Started
***Make sure you have started a new Python project with the Base ADACS Python template***
``` console
cookiecutter gh:ADACS-Australia/adacs_template_python_base
```

See the [Base ADACS Python Template page](https://github.com/ADACS-Australia/adacs_template_python_base) for detailed instructions.

***...render this template on top of it...***
``` console
cookiecutter -f gh:gbpoole/adacs_python_template
```
Make sure any changes to your project have been committed first.

***...look at the changes that have been made, modify them as you see fit, and then commit them to the repository.***

## What do you get for this?
***A codebase that eases collaboration and automatically:***
* A simple ASCII file read/process/write workflow
* A CLI interface, providing simple and self-documenting terminal access to the codebase for your users
